abstract = {The primordial velocity dispersion of dark matter is small compared to the velocities attained during structure formation. The initial density distribution is close to uniform and it occupies an initial sheet in phase space that is single valued in velocity space. Because of gravitational forces this three dimensional manifold evolves in phase space without ever tearing, conserving phase-space volume and preserving the connectivity of nearby points. N-body simulations already follow the motion of this sheet in phase space. This fact can be used to extract full fine-grained phase-space-structure information from existing cosmological N-body simulations. Particles are considered as the vertices of an unstructured three dimensional mesh, moving in six dimensional phase-space. On this mesh, mass density and momentum are uniquely defined. We show how to obtain the space density of the fluid, detect caustics, and count the number of streams as well as their individual contributions to any point in configuration-space. We calculate the bulk velocity, local velocity dispersions, and densities from the sheet - all without averaging over control volumes. This gives a wealth of new information about dark matter fluid flow which had previously been thought of as inaccessible to N-body simulations. We outline how this mapping may be used to create new accurate collisionless fluid simulation codes that may be able to overcome the sparse sampling and unphysical two-body effects that plague current N-body techniques.},

The custodial and parity symmetries can be used to make the tree level contribution to the T parameter and the anomalous couplings of the bottom quark to the Z very small. We show that the resulting quantum numbers typically induce a negative T parameter at one loop that, together with the positive value of the S parameter, restrict considerably these models. There are nevertheless regions of parameter space that successfully reproduce the fit to electroweak precision observables with light Kaluza-Klein excitations accessible at colliders. We consider models of gauge-Higgs unification that implement the custodial and parity symmetries and find that the EW data singles out a very well defined region in parameter space. In this region one typically finds light gauge boson Kaluza-Klein excitations as well as light SU(2){\_}L singlet, and sometimes also doublet, fermionic states, that mix with the top quark, and may yield interesting signatures at future colliders.},

abstract = {We show that the linear dynamics of cosmological perturbations can be described by coupled wave equations, allowing their efficient numerical and, in certain limits, analytical integration directly in position space. The linear evolution of any perturbation can then be analyzed with the Green's function method. Prior to hydrogen recombination, assuming tight coupling between photons and baryons, neglecting neutrino perturbations, and taking isentropic (adiabatic) initial conditions, the obtained Green's functions for all metric, density, and velocity perturbations vanish beyond the acoustic horizon. A localized primordial cosmological perturbation expands as an acoustic wave of photon-baryon density perturbation with narrow spikes at its acoustic wavefronts. These spikes provide one of the main contributions to the cosmic microwave background radiation anisotropy on all experimentally accessible scales. The gravitational interaction between cold dark matter and baryons causes a dip in the observed temperature of the radiation at the center of the initial perturbation. We first model the radiation by a perfect fluid and then extend our analysis to account for finite photon mean free path. The resulting diffusive corrections smear the sharp features in the photon and baryon density Green's functions over the scale of Silk damping.},

abstract = {We present a comparison of major methodologies of fast generating mock halo or galaxy catalogues. The comparison is done for two-point and the three-point clustering statistics. The reference catalogues are drawn from the BigMultiDark N-body simulation. Both friend-of-friends (including distinct halos only) and spherical overdensity (including distinct halos and subhalos) catalogs have been used with the typical number density of a large-volume galaxy surveys. We demonstrate that a proper biasing model is essential for reproducing the power spectrum at quasilinear and even smaller scales. With respect to various clustering statistics a methodology based on perturbation theory and a realistic biasing model leads to very good agreement with N-body simulations. However, for the quadrupole of the correlation function or the power spectrum, only the method based on semi-N-body simulation could reach high accuracy (1{\%} level) at small scales, i.e., r{\textless}25 Mpc/h or k{\textgreater}0.15 h/Mpc. Full N-body solutions will remain indispensable to produce reference catalogues. Nevertheless, we have demonstrated that the far more efficient approximate solvers can reach a few percent accuracy in terms of clustering statistics at the scales interesting for the large-scale structure analysis after calibration with a few reference N-body calculations. This makes them useful for massive production aimed at covariance studies, to scan large parameter spaces, and to estimate uncertainties in data analysis techniques, such as baryon acoustic oscillation reconstruction, redshift distortion measurements, etc.},

We show that the large scale distribution of voids in redshift space traces the fluctuations in the dark matter density field $\delta$(k)(in Fourier space with $\mu$ being the line-of-sight projected k vector), $\delta$vs(k)=(1+$\beta$v$\mu$2)bvs$\delta${\^{}}(k), with a beta factor that will be, in general, different than the one describing the distribution of galaxies. Only if voids are assumed to be quasilocal transformations of the linear (Gaussian) galaxy redshift space field does one get equal beta factors $\beta$v=$\beta$g=f/bg with f being the growth rate and bg, bvs being the galaxy and void bias on large scales defined in redshift space. Indeed, in our mock void catalogs, we measure void beta factors in good agreement with the galaxy one. Further work needs to be done to confirm the level of accuracy of the beta factor equality between voids and galaxies, but in general the void beta factor needs to be considered as a free parameter for linear RSD studies.},

To trace the underlying dark matter distribution, spectroscopic targets will be selected in four classes from imaging data. We will measure luminous red galaxies up to {\$}z=1.0{\$}. To probe the Universe out to even higher redshift, DESI will target bright [O II] emission line galaxies up to {\$}z=1.7{\$}. Quasars will be targeted both as direct tracers of the underlying dark matter distribution and, at higher redshifts ({\$} 2.1 {\textless} z {\textless} 3.5{\$}), for the Ly-{\$}\backslashalpha{\$} forest absorption features in their spectra, which will be used to trace the distribution of neutral hydrogen. When moonlight prevents efficient observations of the faint targets of the baseline survey, DESI will conduct a magnitude-limited Bright Galaxy Survey comprising approximately 10 million galaxies with a median {\$}z\backslashapprox 0.2{\$}. In total, more than 30 million galaxy and quasar redshifts will be obtained to measure the BAO feature and determine the matter power spectrum, including redshift space distortions.},

abstract = {"Modern Cosmology begins with an introduction to the smooth, homogeneous universe described by a Friedman-Robertson-Walker metric, including careful treatments of dark energy, big bang nucleosynthesis, recombination, and dark matter. From this starting point, the reader is introduced to perturbations about an FRW universe: their evolution with the Einstein-Boltzmann equations, their generation by primordial inflation, and their observational consequences. These consequences include the anisotropy spectrum of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) featuring acoustic peaks and polarization, the matter power spectrum with baryonic wiggles, and their detection via photometric galaxy surveys, redshift distortions, cluster abundances, and weak lensing. The book concludes with a long chapter on data analysis. Modern Cosmology is the first book to explain in detail the structure of the acoustic peaks in the CMB, the E/B decomposition in polarization which may allow for detection of primordial gravity waves, and the modern analysis techniques used on increasingly large cosmological data sets. Readers will gain the tools needed to work in cosmology and learn how modern observations are rapidly revolutionizing our picture of the universe. Provides foundations, calculations, and interpretations which illuminate current thinking in cosmology; covers the major advances in cosmology over the past decade; includes over 100 unique, pedagogical figures" 1.

abstract = {We provide scaling relations and fitting formulae for adiabatic cold dark matter cosmologies that account for all baryon effects in the matter transfer function to better than 10{\%} in the large-scale structure regime. They are based upon a physically well-motivated separation of the effects of acoustic oscillations, Compton drag, velocity overshoot, baryon infall, adiabatic damping, Silk damping, and cold-dark-matter growth suppression. We also find a simpler, more accurate, and better motivated form for the zero baryon transfer function than previous works. These descriptions are employed to quantify the amplitude and location of baryonic features in linear theory. While baryonic oscillations are prominent if the baryon fraction exceeds {\$}\backslashOmega{\_}0 h{\^{}}2 + 0.2{\$}, the main effect in more conventional cosmologies is a sharp suppression in the transfer function below the sound horizon. We provide a simple but accurate description of this effect and stress that it is not well approximated by a change in the shape parameter {\$}\backslashGamma{\$}.},

abstract = {We discuss the effects of non-linear structure formation on the signature of acoustic oscillations in the late-time galaxy distribution. We argue that the dominant non-linear effect is the differential motion of pairs of tracers separated by 150 Mpc. These motions are driven by bulk flows and cluster formation and are much smaller than the acoustic scale itself. We present a model for the non-linear evolution based on the distribution of pairwise Lagrangian displacements that provides a quantitative model for the degradation of the acoustic signature, even for biased tracers in redshift space. The Lagrangian displacement distribution can be calibrated with a significantly smaller set of simulations than would be needed to construct a precise power spectrum. By connecting the acoustic signature in the Fourier basis with that in the configuration basis, we show that the acoustic signature is more robust than the usual Fourier-space intuition would suggest because the beat frequency between the peaks and troughs of the acoustic oscillations is a very small wavenumber that is well inside the linear regime. We argue that any possible shift of the acoustic scale is related to infall on 150 Mpc scale, which is O(0.5{\%}) fractionally at first-order even at z=0. For the matter, there is a first-order cancellation such that the mean shift is O(10{\^{}}{\{}-4{\}}). However, galaxy bias can circumvent this cancellation and produce a sub-percent systematic bias.},

abstract = {In fiber-fed galaxy redshift surveys, the finite size of the fiber plugs prevents two fibers from being placed too close to one another, limiting the ability to study galaxy clustering on all scales. We present a new method for correcting such fiber collision effects in galaxy clustering statistics based on spectroscopic observations. The target galaxy sample is divided into two distinct populations according to the targeting algorithm of fiber placement, one free of fiber collisions and the other consisting of collided galaxies. The clustering statistics are a combination of the contributions from these two populations. Our method makes use of observations in tile overlap regions to measure the contributions from the collided population, and to therefore recover the full clustering statistics. The method is rooted in solid theoretical ground and is tested extensively on mock galaxy catalogs. We demonstrate that our method can well recover the projected and the full three-dimensional (3D) redshift-space two-point correlation functions (2PCFs) on scales both below and above the fiber collision scale, superior to the commonly used nearest neighbor and angular correction methods. We discuss potential systematic effects in our method. The statistical correction accuracy of our method is only limited by sample variance, which scales down with (the square root of) the volume probed. For a sample similar to the final SDSS-III BOSS galaxy sample, the statistical correction error is expected to be at the level of 1{\%} on scales ∼0.1-30 h -1 Mpc for the 2PCFs. The systematic error only occurs on small scales, caused by imperfect correction of collision multiplets, and its magnitude is expected to be smaller than 5{\%}. Our correction method, which can be generalized to other clustering statistics as well, enables more accurate measurements of full 3D galaxy clustering on all scales with galaxy redshift surveys. {\textcopyright} 2012.

abstract = {We use a series of high-resolution N-body simulations of the concordance cosmology to investigate the redshift evolution since z = 1 of the properties and alignment with the large-scale structure (LSS) of haloes in clusters, filaments, sheets and voids. We find that (i) once a rescaling of the halo mass with M*(z), the typical mass scale collapsing at redshift z, is performed, there is no further significant redshift dependence in the halo properties; (ii) the environment influences the halo shape and formation time at all investigated redshifts for haloes with masses M {\textless}{\~{}} M* and (iii) there is a significant alignment of both spin and shape of haloes with filaments and sheets. In detail, at all redshifts up to z = 1: (a) haloes with masses below {\~{}} M* tend to be more oblate when located in clusters than in the other environments; this trend is reversed at higher masses: above about M*, haloes in clusters are typically more prolate than similar massive haloes in sheets, filaments and voids. (b) The haloes with M {\textgreater}{\~{}} M* in filaments spin more rapidly than similar mass haloes in clusters; haloes in voids have the lowest median spin parameters. (c) Haloes with M {\textless}{\~{}} M* tend to be younger in voids and older in clusters. (d) In sheets, halo spin vectors tend to lie preferentially within the sheet plane independent of halo mass; in filaments, instead, haloes with M {\textless}{\~{}} M* tend to spin parallel to the filament and higher mass haloes perpendicular to it. For halo masses M {\textgreater}{\~{}} M*, the major axis of haloes in filaments and sheets is strongly aligned with the host filament or the sheet plane, respectively. Such halo-LSS alignments may be of importance in weak lensing analyses of cosmic shear. A question that is opened by our study is why, in the 0 {\textless} z {\textless} 1 redshift regime that we have investigated, the mass scale for gravitational collapse, M*, sets roughly the threshold below which the LSS environment either begins to affect, or reverses, fundamental properties of dark matter haloes.},

abstract = {Sound waves from the primordial fluctuations of the Universe imprinted in the large-scale structure, called baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs), can be used as standard rulers to measure the scale of the Universe. These oscillations have already been detected in the distribution of galaxies. Here we propose to measure BAOs from the troughs (minima) of the density field. Based on two sets of accurate mock halo catalogues with and without BAOs in the seed initial conditions, we demonstrate that the BAO signal cannot be obtained from the clustering of classical disjoint voids, but is clearly detected from overlapping voids. The latter represent an estimate of all troughs of the density field. We compute them from the empty circumsphere centers constrained by tetrahedra of galaxies using Delaunay triangulation. Our theoretical models based on an unprecedented large set of detailed simulated void catalogues are remarkably well confirmed by observational data. We use the largest recently publicly available sample of luminous red galaxies from SDSS-III BOSS DR11 to unveil for the first time a {\textgreater}3{\$}\backslashsigma{\$} BAO detection from voids in observations. Since voids are nearly isotropically expanding regions, their centers represent the most quiet places in the Universe, keeping in mind the cosmos origin and providing a new promising window in the analysis of the cosmological large-scale structure from galaxy surveys.},

abstract = {(Abridged) The 7-year WMAP data and improved astrophysical data rigorously test the standard cosmological model and its extensions. By combining WMAP with the latest distance measurements from BAO and H0 measurement, we determine the parameters of the simplest LCDM model. The power-law index of the primordial power spectrum is n{\_}s=0.968+-0.012, a measurement that excludes the scale-invariant spectrum by 99.5{\%}CL. The other parameters are also improved from the 5-year results. Notable examples of improved parameters are the total mass of neutrinos, sum(m{\_}nu){\textless}0.58eV, and the effective number of neutrino species, N{\_}eff=4.34+0.86-0.88. We detect the effect of primordial helium on the temperature power spectrum and provide a new test of big bang nucleosynthesis. We detect, and show on the map for the first time, the tangential and radial polarization patterns around hot and cold spots of temperature fluctuations, an important test of physical processes at z=1090 and the dominance of adiabatic scalar fluctuations. With the 7-year TB power spectrum, the limit on a rotation of the polarization plane due to potential parity-violating effects has improved to Delta(alpha)=-1.1+-1.4(stat)+-1.5(syst) degrees. We report significant detections of the SZ effect at the locations of known clusters of galaxies. The measured SZ signal agrees well with the expected signal from the X-ray data. However, it is a factor of 0.5 to 0.7 times the predictions from "universal profile" of Arnaud et al., analytical models, and hydrodynamical simulations. We find, for the first time in the SZ effect, a significant difference between the cooling-flow and non-cooling-flow clusters (or relaxed and non-relaxed clusters), which can explain some of the discrepancy. This lower amplitude is consistent with the lower-than-theoretically-expected SZ power spectrum recently measured by the South Pole Telescope collaboration.},

This note outlines methods used the Python GetDist package to calculate marginalized one and two dimensional densities using Kernel Density Estimation (KDE). Many Monte Carlo methods produce correlated and/or weighted samples, for example produced by MCMC, nested, or importance sampling, and there can be hard boundary priors. GetDist's baseline method consists of applying a linear boundary kernel, and then using multiplicative bias correction. The smoothing bandwidth is selected automatically following Botev et al., based on a mixture of heuristics and optimization results using the expected scaling with an effective number of samples (defined to account for MCMC correlations and weights). Two-dimensional KDE use an automatically-determined elliptical Gaussian kernel for correlated distributions. The package includes tools for producing a variety of publication-quality figures using a simple named-parameter interface, as well as a graphical user interface that can be used for interactive exploration. It can also calculate convergence diagnostics, produce tables of limits, and output in latex.},

abstract = {We investigate the necessary methodology to optimally measure the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) signal, from voids based on galaxy redshift catalogues. To this end, we study the dependency of the BAO signal on the population of voids classified by their sizes. We find for the first time the characteristic features of the correlation function of voids including the first robust detection of BAOs in mock galaxy catalogues. These show an anti-correlation around the scale corresponding to the smallest size of voids in the sample (the void exclusion effect), and dips at both sides of the BAO peak, which can be used to determine the significance of the BAO signal without any priori model. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates that there is a scale dependent bias for different populations of voids depending on the radius, with the peculiar property that the void population with the largest BAO significance corresponds to tracers with approximately zero bias on the largest scales. We further investigate the methodology on an additional set of 1,000 realistic mock galaxy catalogues reproducing the SDSS-III/BOSS CMASS DR11 data, to control the impact of sky mask and radial selection function. Our solution is based on generating voids from randoms including the same survey geometry and completeness, and a post-processing cleaning procedure in the holes and at the boundaries of the survey. The methodology and optimal selection of void populations validated in this work have been used to perform the first BAO detection from voids in observations, presented in a companion paper.},

abstract = {Large-scale bulk flows in the Universe distort the initial density field, broadening the baryon-acoustic-oscillation (BAO) feature that was imprinted when baryons were strongly coupled to photons. Additionally, there is a small shift inward in the peak of the conventional overdensity correlation function, a mass-weighted statistic. This shift occurs when high density peaks move toward each other. We explore whether this shift can be removed by applying to the density field a transform (such as a logarithm) that gives fairer statistical weight to fluctuations in underdense regions. Using configuration-space perturbation theory in the Zel'dovich approximation, we find that the log-density correlation function shows a much smaller inward shift in the position of the BAO peak at low redshift than is seen in the overdensity correlation function. We also show that if the initial, Lagrangian density of matter parcels could be estimated at their Eulerian positions, giving a displaced-initial-density field, its peak shift would be even smaller. In fact, a transformed field that accentuates underdensities, such as the reciprocal of the density, pushes the peak the other way, outward. In our model, these shifts in the peak position can be attributed to shift terms, involving the derivative of the linear correlation function, that entirely vanish in this displaced-initial-density field.},

abstract = {We explore the requirements for a Lyman-alpha forest (LyaF) survey designed to measure the angular diameter distance and Hubble parameter at 2{\~{}}{\textless}z{\~{}}{\textless}4 using the standard ruler provided by baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO). The goal would be to obtain a high enough density of sources to probe the three-dimensional density field on the scale of the BAO feature. A percent-level measurement in this redshift range can almost double the Dark Energy Task Force Figure of Merit, relative to the case with only a similar precision measurement at z{\~{}}1, if the Universe is not assumed to be flat. This improvement is greater than the one obtained by doubling the size of the z{\~{}}1 survey, with Planck and a weak SDSS-like z=0.3 BAO measurement assumed in each case. Galaxy BAO surveys at z{\~{}}1 may be able to make an effective LyaF measurement simultaneously at minimal added cost, because the required number density of quasars is relatively small. We discuss the constraining power as a function of area, magnitude limit (density of quasars), resolution, and signal-to-noise of the spectra. For example, a survey covering 2000 sq. deg. and achieving S/N=1.8 per Ang. at g=23 ({\~{}}40 quasars per sq. deg.) with an R{\~{}}{\textgreater}250 spectrograph is sufficient to measure both the radial and transverse oscillation scales to 1.4{\%} from the LyaF (or better, if fainter magnitudes and possibly Lyman-break galaxies can be used). At fixed integration time and in the sky-noise-dominated limit, a wider, noisier survey is generally more efficient; the only fundamental upper limit on noise being the need to identify a quasar and find a redshift. Because the LyaF is much closer to linear and generally better understood than galaxies, systematic errors are even less likely to be a problem.},

abstract = {Opinions on the large-scale structure of the early universe range widely from primeval chaos to a well-ordered mass distribution. P.J.E. Peebles argues that the evolution proceeded from a nearly uniform initial state to a progressively more irregular and clumpy universe. The discussion centers on the largest known structures, the clusters of galaxies, the empirical evidence of the nature of the clustering, and the theories of how the clustering evolves in an expanding universe. In Chapter One the author provides an historical introduction to the subject. Chapter Two contains a survey of methods used to deal with the Newtonian approximation to the theory of the evolution of the mass distribution. Recent progress in the use of statistical measures of the clustering is described in Chapter Three. Chapters Four and Five return to techniques for dealing with cosmic evolution, in the statistical measures of clustering and under general relativity theory. Lastly, in Chapter Six Professor Peebles assesses the progress in attempts to link theory and observation to arrive at a well established physical picture of the nature and evolution of the universe.

These roughly match the expected redshift distribution, though the measured efficiency is slightly lower than expected. The efficiency can be increased by enlarging the redshift range and with incoming pipeline improvement. The cosmological forecast based on these first data predict {\$}\backslashsigma{\_}{\{}D{\_}V{\}}/D{\_}V = 0.023{\$}, in agreement with previous forecasts.

Key to analysing the clustering of these data to provide cosmological measurements is understanding the detailed properties of this sample. Potential issues include variations in the target catalogue caused by changes either in the targeting algorithm or properties of the data used, the pattern of spectroscopic observations, the spatial distribution of targets for which redshifts were not obtained, and variations in the target sky density due to observational systematics.

Utilizing over 112,778 BOSS spectra as a training sample, we produce a photometric redshift catalog for the galaxies in the SDSS DR8 imaging area that, after masking, covers nearly one quarter of the sky (9,913 square degrees). We investigate fluctuations in the number density of objects in this sample as a function of Galactic extinction, seeing, stellar density, sky background, airmass, photometric offset, and North/South Galactic hemisphere. We find that the presence of stars of comparable magnitudes to our galaxies (which are not traditionally masked) effectively remove area. Failing to correct for such stars can produce systematic errors on the measured angular auto-correlation function, w, that are larger than its statistical uncertainty. We describe how one can effectively mask for the presence of the stars, without removing any galaxies from the sample, and minimize the systematic error. Additionally, we apply two separate methods that can be used to correct the systematic errors imparted by any parameter that can be turned into a map on the sky. We find that failing to properly account for varying sky background introduces a systematic error on w. We measure w, in four z{\_}phot slices of width 0.05 between 0.45 {\textless} z{\_}phot {\textless} 0.65 and find that the measurements, after correcting for the systematic effects of stars and sky background, are generally consistent with a generic LambdaCDM model, at scales up to 60 degrees. At scales greater than 3 degrees and z{\_}phot {\textgreater} 0.5, the magnitude of the corrections we apply are greater than the statistical uncertainty in w.},

We measure reddening as the difference between the measured and predicted colors of a star, as derived from stellar parameters from the Sloan Extension for Galactic Understanding and Exploration Stellar Parameter Pipeline. We achieve uncertainties of 56, 34, 25, and 29mmag in the colors u - g, g - r, r - i, and i - z, per star, though the uncertainty varies depending on the stellar type and the magnitude of the star. The spectrum-based reddening measurements confirm our earlier "blue tip" reddening measurements, finding reddening coefficients different by -3{\%}, 1{\%}, 1{\%}, and 2{\%} in u - g, g - r, r - i, and i - z from those found by the blue tip method, after removing a 4{\%} normalization difference. These results prefer an RV = 3.1 Fitzpatrick reddening law to O'Donnell or Cardelli et al. reddening laws. We provide a table of conversion coefficients from the Schlegel et al.

abstract = {We present a full sky 100 micron map that is a reprocessed composite of the COBE/DIRBE and IRAS/ISSA maps, with the zodiacal foreground and confirmed point sources removed. Before using the ISSA maps, we remove the remaining artifacts from the IRAS scan pattern. Using the DIRBE 100 micron and 240 micron data, we have constructed a map of the dust temperature, so that the 100 micron map can be converted to a map proportional to dust column density. The result of these manipulations is a map with DIRBE-quality calibration and IRAS resolution. To generate the full sky dust maps, we must first remove zodiacal light contamination as well as a possible cosmic infrared background (CIB). This is done via a regression analysis of the 100 micron DIRBE map against the Leiden- Dwingeloo map of H{\_}I emission, with corrections for the zodiacal light via a suitable expansion of the DIRBE 25 micron flux. For the 100 micron map, no significant CIB is detected. In the 140 micron and 240 micron maps, where the zodiacal contamination is weaker, we detect the CIB at surprisingly high flux levels of 32 $\backslash$pm 13 nW/m{\^{}}2/sr at 140 micron, and 17 $\backslash$pm 4 nW/m{\^{}}2/sr at 240 micron (95{\%} confidence). This integrated flux is {\~{}}2 times that extrapolated from optical galaxies in the Hubble Deep Field. The primary use of these maps is likely to be as a new estimator of Galactic extinction. We demonstrate that the new maps are twice as accurate as the older Burstein-Heiles estimates in regions of low and moderate reddening. These dust maps will also be useful for estimating millimeter emission that contaminates CMBR experiments and for estimating soft X-ray absorption.},

abstract = {We present a model for the distribution of void sizes and its evolution in the context of hierarchical scenarios of gravitational structure formation. We find that at any cosmic epoch the voids have a size distribution which is well-peaked about a characteristic void size which evolves self-similarly in time. This is in distinct contrast to the distribution of virialized halo masses which does not have a small-scale cut-off. In our model, the fate of voids is ruled by two processes. The first process affects those voids which are embedded in larger underdense regions: the evolution is effectively one in which a larger void is made up by the mergers of smaller voids, and is analogous to how massive clusters form from the mergers of less massive progenitors. The second process is unique to voids, and occurs to voids which happen to be embedded within a larger scale overdensity: these voids get squeezed out of existence as the overdensity collapses around them. It is this second process which produces the cut-off at small scales. In the excursion set formulation of cluster abundance and evolution, solution of the cloud-in-cloud problem, i.e., counting as clusters only those objects which are not embedded in larger clusters, requires study of random walks crossing one barrier. We show that a similar formulation of void evolution requires study of a two-barrier problem: one barrier is required to account for voids-in-voids, and the other for voids-in-clouds. Thus, in our model, the void size distribution is a function of two parameters, one of which reflects the dynamics of void formation, and the other the formation of collapsed objects.},

abstract = {The lecture notes describe the Delaunay Tessellation Field Estimator for Cosmic Web analysis. The high sensitivity of Voronoi/Delaunay tessellations to the local point distribution is used to obtain estimates of density and related quantities. The adaptive and minimum triangulation properties of Delaunay tessellations are utilized for interpolation to continuous volume-covering density and velocity fields. The adaptivity to the local density and geometry preserves three key characteristics of the cosmic matter distribution: 1) its hierarchical nature,2) its anisotropic weblike morphology, 3) the presence and structure of voids. The lecture notes discuss the mathematical context and background of the DTFE method, in essence a first order version of Natural Neighbour methods, smooth and higher order spatial interpolation techniques. This is followed by an outline of the DTFE procedure. A series of tests on spatially complex point distributions provides quantitative information on its performance and noise characteristics. We conclude with a few cosmological applications. The reconstruction of the spatial weblike patterns in N-body simulations and in the 2dFGRS provide a visual impression of DTFE's performance. The analysis of the velocity divergence pdf and maps obtained of the velocity flow in the Local Universe (implied by PSCz) illustrate its promise for probing the dynamics of cosmic structure. The Watershed Void Finder (Platen et al. 2007), for the study of voids, and Multiscale Morphology Filter (Aragon-Calvo et al. 2007), for identifying and analyzing weblike networks of filaments, sheets and clusters, are based upon DTFE density fields. We also mention SimpleX, a related random lattice radiative transfer formalism (Ritzerveld {\&} Icke 2006).},

abstract = {The accelerating expansion of the universe is the most surprising cosmological discovery in many decades, implying that the universe is dominated by some form of "dark energy" with exotic physical properties, or that Einstein's theory of gravity breaks down on cosmological scales. The profound implications of cosmic acceleration have inspired ambitious experimental efforts to measure the history of expansion and growth of structure with percent-level precision or higher. We review in detail the four most well established methods for making such measurements: Type Ia supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), weak gravitational lensing, and galaxy clusters. We pay particular attention to the systematic uncertainties in these techniques and to strategies for controlling them at the level needed to exploit "Stage IV" dark energy facilities such as BigBOSS, LSST, Euclid, and WFIRST. We briefly review a number of other approaches including redshift-space distortions, the Alcock-Paczynski test, and direct measurements of H{\_}0. We present extensive forecasts for constraints on the dark energy equation of state and parameterized deviations from GR, achievable with Stage III and Stage IV experimental programs that incorporate supernovae, BAO, weak lensing, and CMB data. We also show the level of precision required for other methods to provide constraints competitive with those of these fiducial programs. We emphasize the value of a balanced program that employs several of the most powerful methods in combination, both to cross-check systematic uncertainties and to take advantage of complementary information. Surveys to probe cosmic acceleration produce data sets with broad applications, and they continue the longstanding astronomical tradition of mapping the universe in ever greater detail over ever larger scales.},

We also introduce more careful approaches for deriving a suitable covariance matrix and fitting model for galaxy correlation functions. Our covariance matrix technique guarantees smooth diagonal and off-diagonal terms by fitting a modified Gaussian covariance matrix to that calculated from mock catalogues. Our proposed fitting model is effective at removing broad-band effects such as redshift-space distortions, scale-dependent bias and any artefacts introduced by assuming the wrong model cosmology. These all aid in obtaining a more accurate measurement of the acoustic scale and its error. We validate these techniques on 160 mock catalogues derived from the LasDamas simulations in real and redshift space. We then apply these techniques to the DR7 LRG sample and find that the error on the acoustic scale decreases from ∼3.5 per cent before reconstruction to ∼1.9 per cent after reconstruction. We also see an increase in our BAO detection confidence from ∼3$\sigma$ to ∼4$\sigma$ after reconstruction with our confidence level in measuring the correct acoustic scale increasing from ∼3$\sigma$ to ∼5$\sigma$. Using the mean of the acoustic scale probability distributions produced from our fits, we find D v/r s = 8.89 ± 0.31 before reconstruction and 8.88 ± 0.17 after reconstruction.

abstract = {We develop a methodology to optimise the measurement of Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) from a given galaxy sample. In our previous work, we demonstrated that one can measure BAO from tracers in under-dense regions (voids). In this study, we combine the over-dense and under-dense tracers (galaxies {\&} voids) to obtain better constraints on the BAO scale. To this end, we modify the de-wiggled BAO model with an additional parameter to describe both the BAO peak and the underlying exclusion pattern of void 2PCFs. We show that after applying BAO reconstruction to galaxies, the BAO peak scale of both galaxies and voids are unbiased using the modified model. Furthermore, we use a new 2PCF estimator for a multi-tracer analysis with galaxies and voids. In simulations, the joint sample improves by about 10{\%} the constraint for the post-reconstruction BAO peak position compared to the result from galaxies alone, which is equivalent to an enlargement of the survey volume by 20{\%}. Applying this method to the BOSS DR12 data, we have an 18{\%} improvement for the low-z sample (0.2{\textless}z{\textless}0.5), but a worse constraint for the high-z sample (0.5{\textless}z{\textless}0.75), which is consistent with statistical fluctuations for the current survey volume. Future larger samples will give more robust improvements due to less statistical fluctuations.},

@article{Zhao2016,
abstract = {We present a novel parameter-free cosmological void finder ($\backslash$textsc{\{}dive{\}}, Delaunay TrIangulation Void findEr) based on Delaunay Triangulation (DT), which efficiently computes the empty spheres constrained by a discrete set of tracers. We define the spheres as DT voids, and describe their properties, including an universal density profile together with an intrinsic scatter. We apply this technique on 100 halo catalogues with volumes of 2.5$\backslash$,{\$}h{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$}Gpc side each, with a bias and number density similar to the BOSS CMASS Luminous Red Galaxies, performed with the $\backslash$textsc{\{}patchy{\}} code. Our results show that there are two main species of DT voids, which can be characterised by the radius: they have different responses to halo redshift space distortions, to number density of tracers, and reside in different dark matter environments. Based on dynamical arguments using the tidal field tensor, we demonstrate that large DT voids are hosted in expanding regions, whereas the haloes used to construct them reside in collapsing ones. Our approach is therefore able to efficiently determine the troughs of the density field from galaxy surveys, and can be used to study their clustering. We further study the power spectra of DT voids, and find that the bias of the two populations are different, demonstrating that the small DT voids are essentially tracers of groups of haloes.},
